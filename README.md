# Hello! I'm Matt Wilson, a front end developer.
### These are things I built.
If I applied for a job at your company,  I want you to look at them.
Thanks for taking the time, and for making it this far.

## The things I built are:
---

#### Front end:
- Three.js (WebGL Javascript library for 3d animations)

### Spotify, But It Doesn't Make Me Angry
Unonpinionated Spotify clone. 
Handles playback, search, lyrics, and playlist operations without trying to influence what the user listens to.
Doesn't plaster your homepage with ads for that one podcast you listened to 5 minutes of that one time.
Doesn't go "Hi Matt! We noticed you remembered being in high school and listened to an Incubus song the other day. HOW ABOUT YOU LISTEN TO HOOBASTANK NOW?!"
#### Front End
- React
- Spotify Developer API
- Spotify Web API Node
- React Bootstrap
#### Back End
