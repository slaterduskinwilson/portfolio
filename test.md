### "Spotify, But It Doesn't Make Me Angry"
Unonpinionated Spotify clone. 
Handles playback, search, lyrics, and playlist operations without trying to influence what the user listens to.
Doesn't plaster your homepage with ads for that one podcast you listened to 5 minutes of that one time.
Doesn't go "Hi Matt! We noticed you remembered being in high school and listened to an Incubus song the other day. HOW ABOUT YOU LISTEN TO HOOBASTANK NOW?!"
